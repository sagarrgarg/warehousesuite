4. Check console for JavaScript errors

```bash
# Check user permissions
bench --site your-site-name console
```

```python
import frappe
user = "test@example.com"
roles = frappe.get_roles(user)
print(f"User roles: {roles}")

# Check if user has access to POW Profile
profiles = frappe.get_all("POW Profile User", 
    filters={"user": user}, 
    fields=["parent"])
print(f"User profiles: {profiles}")
```

### Issue 2: No Warehouses Showing

**Symptoms**: Warehouse dropdown is empty

**Solutions**:
1. Check POW Profile warehouse configuration
2. Verify warehouse permissions
3. Check warehouse status (enabled/disabled)

profile = frappe.get_doc("POW Profile", "your-profile-name")
print(f"Source warehouses: {[w.warehouse for w in profile.source_warehouse]}")
print(f"Target warehouses: {[w.warehouse for w in profile.target_warehouse]}")
```

### Issue 3: Transfer Operations Failing

**Symptoms**: Transfer creation fails with errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check stock availability

item_code = "ITEM-001"
warehouse = "WAREHOUSE-001"
stock = frappe.db.get_value("Bin", 
    {"item_code": item_code, "warehouse": warehouse}, 
    "actual_qty")
print(f"Stock for {item_code} in {warehouse}: {stock}")
```
